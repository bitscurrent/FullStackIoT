## Overview
This project is a Internet Of Things (IoT) based smart lighting system using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), Arduino Uno, and Raspberry Pi. The system automatically controls a bulb based on ambient light levels and provides a web UI where users can:

-- Monitor the LDR sensor readings in real-time.
-- Override the automatic process and manually control the bulb remotely using web app.
